Beat the egg yolks in a bowl. <br>Gradually stir one cup of the hot cream mixture into the eggs, several tablespoons at a time.<br> This will help to bring the eggs up to temperature without scrambling them.<br> Stir the egg mixture back into the cream mixture in the saucepan.<br> Cook and stir over low heat until the mixture just coats the back of a spoon,<br> 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl; cover. Refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>Stir the lemon juice into the cold ice cream mixture. Freeze in a 4 to 5 quart ice cream <br>maker according to manufacturer's directions. Transfer ice cream to a lidded freezer container, <br>and freeze for 4 hours to ripen flavors before serving.</li>
